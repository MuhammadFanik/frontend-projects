                <h3>READ<span> OUR TERMS</span> </h3>
                <p>In order to confirm your reservation, it's important that you agree to our Terms and Conditions, which outline the rental agreement.</p>

        <div class="term-item">
            <h3 class="term-heading">Driver Requirements & Age Restrictions:</h3>
            <p class="term-desc">In order to rent a vehicle, you must meet our minimum age requirement, which is typically 25 years old (may vary by location). A valid driver's license issued in your name and held for a minimum period (often 1 year) is required. Additional restrictions may apply to young drivers (under 25) or drivers with certain endorsements on their license. We reserve the right to deny rental to any person who does not meet our qualifications. If you plan on adding additional drivers to the rental agreement, they must also meet the same requirements and be present at the time of pick-up with their valid licenses.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="term-item">
            <h3 class="term-heading">Vehicle Selection & Availability:</h3>
            <p class="term-desc">While we strive to fulfill your reservation request for a specific vehicle type, we cannot guarantee the availability of a particular make or model. Our confirmation will specify the vehicle category you reserved (e.g., economy, SUV) and a guaranteed similar or upgraded vehicle within that class will be provided upon pick-up. In the rare case that a vehicle within your reserved category is unavailable, we will contact you beforehand to discuss alternative options.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="term-item">
            <h3 class="term-heading">Rental Rates & Payment:</h3>
            <p class="term-desc">The total cost of your rental will be clearly displayed during the reservation process and will be broken down into base rates, applicable taxes, and any additional fees you choose (e.g., optional insurance). We accept most major credit cards for payment. A deposit may also be required at the time of pick-up, depending on the chosen vehicle class and insurance options. The deposit amount will be fully refunded upon return of the vehicle in the same condition it was rented.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="term-item">
            <h3 class="term-heading">Rental Period & Extensions:</h3>
            <p class="term-desc"> Your rental period begins at the designated pick-up time and ends at the designated return time as specified in your confirmation. Returning the vehicle late will result in additional fees based on the extent of the delay. If you anticipate needing the car for longer than your original reservation, please contact us as soon as possible to inquire about extending your rental. Extensions are subject to availability and may require an adjusted rate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="term-item">
            <h3 class="term-heading">Vehicle Use & Prohibited Activities:</h3>
            <p class="term-desc">The rental vehicle is for your personal use only and must be operated in a safe and lawful manner. Smoking and any illegal activity are strictly prohibited within the vehicle. Taking the vehicle off-road, exceeding the speed limit, or using the vehicle to tow another vehicle are also not permitted. Mileage restrictions may apply depending on your chosen rental plan. You are responsible for any damage caused to the vehicle during the rental period, with the exception of normal wear and tear. You are also liable for any tolls, parking tickets, or fines incurred while using the vehicle.</p>
